I recently attempted to set up OpenLens to work with `kubectl`, but all I encountered was a blank white screen. Despite having everything configured correctly and being able to list all the clusters, the connection seemed established. To verify if you have a similar connection, you can try running this command:

<Code code={`$ kubectl get pods`} language="bash" />

The expected output of this command should display a list of your available pods. If the connection is established correctly, you'll see something like:

<Code code={`NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE  
your-pod-name-1               1/1     Running   0          1d  
your-pod-name-2               1/1     Running   0          1d  `} language="sql" />

I soon discovered that OpenLens is built using Electron and React, which led me to a simple solution. **By pressing `cmd + R` to refresh the view, I managed to fix the issue, and the clusters view appeared as expected**. This quick refresh can be a helpful trick if you ever find yourself facing the same problem when working with OpenLens and kubectl.
