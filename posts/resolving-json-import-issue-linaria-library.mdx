Recently, I faced a bug related to the Linaria library that prevented my page from building. I stumbled upon this issue when attempting to import JSON files in a component where Linaria was utilized. Instead of processing the JSON file correctly, Linaria treated it like a JavaScript file, leading to parsing errors. I attempted to exclude all JSON files in the Linaria configuration using a simple regex, but it didn't seem to work properly.

Here's a screenshot of the exact error I encountered: (screenshot here).

Before fixing the issue, my configuration looked like this:

<ArticleImage src="/posts/resolving-json-import-issue-linaria-library/screenshot.png" alt={`Linaria bug`} objectFit="contain" />


<Code code={`const shaker = require('@linaria/shaker').default;  
  
module.exports = {  
    rules: [    
      {  
        test:  /\.json/,  
        action: "ignore"  
      },  
      {  
        test: /node_modules/,  
        action: 'ignore'  
      },      
      {  
        action: shaker  
      },      
    ]  
}`} />

As you can see, I'm ignoring all the .json files and node_modules. Additionally, I have the shaker plugin added as the last rule.

After some debugging and setting breakpoints in the code, I discovered that the issue was being caused by the shaker plugin. Under the hood, the rules are applied in reverse order, and the order matters. Since I set the shaker as the last rule, it ran as the first one. As a result, it didn't respect the other rules and failed to ignore the files I intended to exclude, causing the issue.

To fix this problem, I simply needed to place the shaker action as the first rule:


<Code code={`const shaker = require('@linaria/shaker').default;  
  
module.exports = {  
    rules: [  
      {  
        action: shaker  
      },    
      {  
        test:  /\.json/,  
        action: "ignore"  
      },  
      {  
        test: /node_modules/,  
        action: 'ignore'  
      },          
    ]  
}`} />

By placing the shaker action as the first rule, I was able to resolve the issue and successfully exclude the JSON files and node_modules from processing.
