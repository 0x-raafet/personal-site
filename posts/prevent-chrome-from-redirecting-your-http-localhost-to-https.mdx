Every time I tried setting up custom `/etc/hosts` for local development, chrome kept redirecting my service from HTTP to HTTPS.
Probably because there was already an existing website with the same hostname and SSL that I previously visited.
To fix that you need to go to `chrome://net-internals/#hsts` and put your service's URL in the input located under the **Delete domain security policies** section. Click delete and voil√†!
