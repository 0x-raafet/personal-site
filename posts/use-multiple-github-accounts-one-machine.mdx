I needed to create a new GitHub account for work, but I didn't want to switch my credentials every time I pushed, cloned, or pulled from my private repositories. 

I quickly googled how to achieve this without much hassle, and here it is:

<br />
<br />

### 1. Generate the SSH keys for both your work and private emails. 

It will ask you to enter a unique file name and passphrase. I liked the file name pattern from the other [blog post][source], so I borrowed (stole) it - `id_rsa_personal` and `id_rsa_work`
Don't forget to save the passphrase somewhere safe! For example in [1password](https://1password.com/). 

<Code code={`$ cd .ssh/  
  
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your-private-email@email.com"  
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your-work-email@email.com"`} language="bash" />

I am not sure if you should keep the commands' output, but I did! Just in case!  

### 2. Copy the SSH keys and paste them into the appropriate GitHub account

<Code code={`$ ls  
  
$ cat id_rsa_personal.pub | pbcopy  
$ cat id_rsa_work.pub | pbcopy`}
language="bash" /> 

Log in to the appropriate GitHub account, go to settings. Click on the `SSH and GPG keys`, and paste one of the ssh keys.

### 3. Setup SSH config

You need to create an SSH config with both hosts configured.

<Code code={`$ vim ~/.ssh/config  
  
# replace IdentityFile with your own file name and :wq
  
Host me.github.com  
  HostName github.com  
  User git  
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal  
   
Host work.github.com   
  HostName github.com  
  User git  
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work`} language="bash" />

### 4. Add the SSH keys to the SSH Agent

<Code code={`$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal  
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work`} language="bash" />

### 5. Clone the repository to test things out

<Code code={`$ git clone git@work.github.com:orgName/repoName.git`} language="bash" />
