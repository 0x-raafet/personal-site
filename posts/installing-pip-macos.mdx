In this blog post, I'll discuss a situation where I wanted to install a module using pip (the package installer for Python) but encountered an unexpected error: zsh: command not found: pip. This was quite surprising, as I assumed that Python, along with pip, was installed by default on macOS.

As it turns out, while Python is indeed installed by default on macOS, pip is not, and you'll need to download it separately. Additionally, the downloaded version is `pip3`, so you'll have to create an alias for `pip` since some tools or documentation still reference the older command.

To accomplish this, you can use the following one-liner:

<Code code={`python3 -m ensurepip && echo 'alias pip=pip3' >>~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile`} language="bash" />

This command does the following:

- Installs pip directly from the Python3 library
- Adds an alias `pip -> pip3` to your `~/.bash_profile`, ensuring that you don't have to recreate the alias every time you restart your computer
- Reloads the `~/.bash_profile` file
  
After running this command, you should be able to execute the pip command without any issues.
