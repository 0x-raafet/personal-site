I have always used the `cat` command to quickly preview some files or to copy the contents of them to a clipboard. The second part was always working great, but previewing a let's say JavaScript file or RC file was painful, because of the lack of syntax highlighting.

I was too lazy to search for solutions, but my colleague recently showed me something called [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), which is a cat, but on steroids. Here's a little preview of what it looks like:

### Installation and theme setup

You can install it through brew, just like this:

<Code code={`$ brew install bat`} language="bash" />

and if you don't like the default theme, you can choose some that are installed out of the box or [install the custom one](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#adding-new-themes). I decided to use Nord, which was already installed, here's how I did it:

<Code code={`$ mkdir ~/.config/bat  
$ sudo vim ~/.config/bat/config # remember to run it in sudo mode`} language="bash" />

then paste this line into the config

<Code code={`--theme="Nord"`} language="bash" />

and exit vim with `:wq` and you're done!

P.S you can still copy the contents of the file with `bat something.txt | pbcopy`! ü§†
