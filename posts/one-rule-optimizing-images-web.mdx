A good rule of thumb for optimizing images: **Lazy load everything that is below the fold, eagerly load everything above the fold, with fetch priority set to high**. Serve all images in webp/avif format.  

Although native lazy loading is getting traction right now. I would not recommend using it, since it is only lazy-loading if the user's network is slow, which is unreliable and can hurt your website's bandwidth usage. Read more this new feature here https://addyosmani.com/blog/lazy-loading/  

AVIF images are ~20% smaller than WebP ones, but they also take 20% longer to generate. AVIF is [supported only by Chrome & Firefox](https://caniuse.com/avif). Use AVIF if you generate images in build time and WebP if in runtime.  

WebP is [well supported](https://caniuse.com/webp) in all major browsers, except older versions of Safari, so remember to always have a fallback for JPEGs  

There are at least two ways to serve optimized images in HTML:
- [Picture element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture)
- [Img element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#using_the_srcset_and_sizes_attributes) 

Both work very similarly, but the picture element allows to declare fallback whilst img element does not.  

If you're using Next.js I highly recommend checking out next/image component. It has great defaults, adapts best practices, and works great in small & big scale projects. https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization
