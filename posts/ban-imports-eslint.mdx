Sometimes you don't want to use some modules from a library or other part of your code. 

Maybe you're using a third-party dependency that contains modules with poor performance, bugs, or doesn't tree-shake them correctly. Maybe you want to create a modular architecture with ESLint config per module and ban imports from other modules.

No matter the use case, the goal is the same - you want to prevent your colleagues (or your future self) from using it.

For such and other cases, you can use the [no-restricted-imports](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/) rule in ESLint. In the example given below, I banned the performance-heavy modules in the Chakra-UI library. If someone tries to use it, it will throw an error.


<Code code={`module.exports = {
  // ... removed for brevity
  rules: {
    "no-restricted-imports": [
      "error",
      {
        paths: [
          {
            name: "@chakra-ui/react",
            importNames: [
              "Modal",
              "Checkbox",
              "Drawer",
              "Collapse",
              "Fade",
              "ScaleFade",
              "SlideFace",
              "Slide",
              "Transition",
              "Menu",
              "Accordion",
              "Toast",
              "Tooltip",
              "Popover",
              "PopoverTransition",
            ],
            message:
              "These imports are banned due to their dependence on framer-motion which bloats our bundle size. Please use our own implementation of that component. ",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    // ... removed for brevity
  },
};
`} language="javascript" />
