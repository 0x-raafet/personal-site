I recently encountered a situation where I needed to open a new tab on mobile devices using JavaScript. Initially, I used the following code:

<Code code={`window.open(url, '_blank');`} language="js" />

It worked well, but when I tested it on Safari, I quickly discovered that Safari's security policies prevent opening a new tab within an asynchronous function, such as inside a promise. To address this issue, I had to find a workaround.

The most effective workaround I found involved the following steps:

<Code code={`var windowReference = window.open();  
  
myService.getUrl().then(function(url) {  
  windowReference.location = url;  
});`} language="js" />

The key here is to declare a variable with a reference to the `window.open()` object outside of the asynchronous function. Then, reassign the location to the desired URL where you previously called the window.open function.
