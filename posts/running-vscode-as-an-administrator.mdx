I wanted to utilize the code . command in the terminal to directly open VSCode in my desired directory. To achieve this, I navigated to the VSCode Command Palette and chose `>Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`. However, I encountered an error message stating "permissions denied" and that administrator access was required for this action.

After some searching, I discovered several solutions to run VSCode as an administrator. The following command was the only one that worked for me:

<Code code={`$ sudo /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron; exit`} language="bash" />

Upon executing this command, VSCode should open, allowing you to select the `>Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` option.
