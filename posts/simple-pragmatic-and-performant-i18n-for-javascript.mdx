There're great libraries for i18n that support absolutely everything like interpolation with React components, server-side rendering, and code splitting (or maybe I should call it - JSON splitting). This is one example of such library - [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/). 

The biggest drawback and issue, something that keeps me from using it is its bundle size. Assuming you're using gzip for compression like everyone else, it will take 20kB+ from your bundle. For some people/teams it's an acceptable amount, but for me, I don't believe it to be a good trade-off.

<div style={{ display: "grid", gridGap: "10px", gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))" }}>

</div>


And that's why I decided to write my implementation that has great DX (supports dotted paths with autocompletion) and is easy to scale/maintain. I used the [`js-cookie`](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) library to get and parse the cookie with legible & declarative API. 

The example is done specifically for Next.js, but you can seamlessly port it to any other library/framework.

<Code language="tsx" code={`// i18n.ts  
  
import Cookies from "js-cookie";  
import get from "lodash/get";  
import { en } from "./en";  
  
type Locales = "en";  
  
const defaultTranslations: Record<Locales, Partial<typeof en>> = {  
  en,  
};  
  
export const t = (key: Join<PathsToStringProps<typeof en>, ".">, translations = defaultTranslations) => {  
  const locale = Cookies.get("NEXT_LOCALE") as Locales;  
  return get(translations[locale] || translations["en"], key);  
};  
  
type PathsToStringProps<T> = T extends string  
  ? []  
  : {  
      [K in Extract<keyof T, string>]: [K, ...PathsToStringProps<T[K]>];  
    }[Extract<keyof T, string>];  
  
type Join<T extends string[], D extends string> = T extends []  
  ? never  
  : T extends [infer F]  
  ? F  
  : T extends [infer F, ...infer R]  
  ? F extends string  
    ? \`\${F}\${D}\${Join<Extract<R, string[]>, D>}\`  
    : never  
  : string;  
`} />

This is how the translations file looks like

<Code language="typescript" code={`// en.ts  
  
export const en = {  
  ctaSection: {  
    title: "Some value for demo purposes",
    // ...The rest of the items, removed for brevity  
  }  
}`} />

And this is how you use it:  
  
<ArticleImage src="/posts/simple-pragmatic-and-performant-i18n-for-javascript/usage.png" alt={`An example of how you could use the "t" function`} objectFit="contain" />

You don't have to worry about the performance unless the file exceeds a few hundred lines. After that, you can use dynamic imports and split the translations file into smaller chunks.
