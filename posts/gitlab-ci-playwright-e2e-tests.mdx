I recently had the opportunity to explore GitLab CI and was pleasantly surprised by its simplicity, compared to GitHub Actions. While working with Playwright, I wanted to automate E2E tests to run every time a merge request is opened. This setup helps maintain code quality and streamline the development process.

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure GitLab CI and Playwright for E2E testing:

1. **Modify the Playwright configuration file**: Edit the `playwright.config.js` file as shown below. Include the `reporter` property only if you want to display [unit test reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/unit_test_reports.html) in the GitLab UI.

<Code code={`export default defineConfig({  
  /* ...removed for brevity... */  
  reporter: [["html"], ["junit", { outputFile: "results.xml" }]],  
  use: {  
    /* Base URL to use in actions like \`await page.goto('/')\`. */  
    baseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:3000",  
    trace: "on-first-retry",  
  },  
  /* ...removed for brevity... */  
  webServer: {  
    command: "yarn dev --port 3000",  
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3000",  
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,  
  }  
})  
`} language="typescript" /> 

The `reuseExistingServer` flag ensures that the local development server is reused instead of starting a new one, unless the CI environment variable is set (i.e., when running tests in GitLab CI).

2. **Update your `gitlab-ci.yml` file**: Add the following step to set up E2E tests in GitLab CI:

<Code code={`E2E tests:  
  interruptible: true  
  when: on_success  
  stage: test  
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.32.0-focal  
  needs: [Prep] # You may not need this or may adjust it, depending on your setup  
  script:  
    - yarn e2e:headless  
  artifacts:  
    when: always  
    paths:  
      - playwright-report/  
      - test-results/  
      - results.xml  
    reports:  
      junit: results.xml  
    expire_in: 1 week`} language="yaml" />

This step defines an E2E test stage, which uses the Playwright Docker image and runs the tests using the `yarn e2e:headless` command.

3. **Add the "e2e:headless" script to `package.json`**:

<Code code={`"e2e:headless": "playwright test"`} language="json" />

With this configuration, GitLab CI will run E2E tests using Playwright automatically for every merge request, ensuring seamless quality control and improving your development workflow.
